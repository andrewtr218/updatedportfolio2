# updatedportfolio
Updated portfolio uses 3 html files and a style.css file to set up a basic portfolio with links to some of my other projects

## Index.html
Index.html is the home page of the portfolio and can be navigated to by either selecting my name, "Andrew Rogers", or the link to the Bio on the navbar. The contact link links to the contact.html page. The gallery page links to a carousel of pictures and portfolio projects. All of this is powered by bootstrap.

## Contact.html
The user can enter in their personal information and a message and click submit. Nothing will happen yet but the framework is in place.

## Gallery.html
The user can scroll through a selection of icons each linking to a different project, past, present or current. These are in the same corner as the dropdown menu.
